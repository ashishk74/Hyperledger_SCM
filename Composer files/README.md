This is the readme file for the Business Network Definition created in Playground

The folder structure created from bna file being unzipped.

Have created the permissions.acl completely from the live session from Akash. Did not make changes, just updated my use cases in such a way that the requirement is met. Did not update the permissions.acl as its not mentioned in prob statement.

Have created the model file as per requirement and hence no comments to it. Its a pretty direct file which should not need any comments as its common sense.

Have created the script.js and have updated the comments over every major statement area along with what it does in a way that i think which makes sense for a developer.
